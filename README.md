This repository hosts the maps generated of several slices of mathematics education research. 

These maps can be used standalone as an exploratory tool to look at citation patterns within the articles published in JRME, ESM, or FLM. 

They can also be used in conjunction with *Perturbations of the Sensible: An Aesthetic Atlas of Mathematics Education Research*, a dissertation and book written by Christopher Dubbs. There, I unpack these maps through the metaphor of bubbles and foams: mathematics education research appears to be an ontologically solid object, however, by tracing the emergence, dissapearance, merging, and splitting of bubbles of research, these bubbles together merely constitute a foam. This foam, the object referrred to as 'mathematics education research' during each decade is argued to be a volatile construct, one that necessarily shifts across time. Then, the state of the field at any particular time should not be interpreted to be the inevitable destination, rather, what the field becomes is what we are mathematics education researchers make of it. The inclusion/exclusion of particular topics are merely aesthetic decisions, we are freer than we think in the directions that we push the field.
